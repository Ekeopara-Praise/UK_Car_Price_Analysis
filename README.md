## Project Description
The determination of car prices has been known to be dependent on some factors which when not properly analyzed may become a challenge for futuristic intentions of reselling cars. Data collected from cars sold in the UK were used as a case study, addressing these issues. 

To effectively conduct this analysis, statistical methodologies such as:
* exploratory data analysis
* correlation analysis
* hypothesis testing and 
* predictive analytics 

were implemented to answer certain basic statistical questions. 

## Outline of Analysis
- Step 1: Get data and cleanup
- Step 2: Explore Data (asking useful questions)
- Step 3: Perform correlation analysis on car prices vs car features
- Step 4: Test that prices vary for different car models (Hypothesis testing)
- Step 5: Predict car prices (using suitable performance matrices)
- Step 6: Report of analysis
